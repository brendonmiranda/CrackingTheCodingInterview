# Inheritance 

When creating a new class in Java, you can define the class as inheriting from an existing class. 

Inheritance is the process by which a subclass automatically includes any public or protected members of the class, including primitives, objects, or methods, defined in the parent class. 

_The inheritance definition above was found in the book OCP Java SE 11 Developer - Complete study guide. By Jeanne Boyarsky & Scott Selikoff._
