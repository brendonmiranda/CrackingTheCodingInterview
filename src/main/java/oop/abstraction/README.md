# Abstraction

Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. You donâ€™t need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.

Abstraction in Java is implemented through interfaces and abstract classes. They are used to create a base implementation or contract for the actual implementation classes.
