# Cracking The Coding Interview Questions

This repo register my evolution in the Cracking The Coding Interview book as I go through its questions and solutions. 

# Chapter 5 | Bit Manipulation

[**5.1** Insertion: You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M=10011, you can assume that there ate at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and 2.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question51.java)

[**5.3** Binary to String: You have an integer, and you can flip exactly one bit from 0 to 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1's you could create.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question53.java)

[**5.4** Next Number: Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question54.java)

[**5.6** Conversion: Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question56.java)

[**5.7** Pairwise Swap: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible.](https://github.com/brendonmiranda/CrackingTheCodingInterview/blob/main/src/main/java/cracking/the/code/interview/chapter5/Question57.java)
